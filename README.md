This project is a bluetooth controlled car which is controlled using app on andriod phone. When we were searching for project as my brother's son like car very much. He always like to play wuth a car from that i got a idea to build a car as my project and then i am 
gonna gift him on his birthday next month. <br/>
Here is a image of car which i have build as a project. 

# Material Required
- Arduino Uno<br/>
- Bluetooth HC-06<br/>
- Jump Wires<br/>
- Breadboard<br/>
- L298N Motor Driver<br/>
- 2 X Special Kind of Battery (18650 li-ion battery 3.7V)<br/>
- Battery Holder<br/>
- 4 X Micro motors <br/>
- 4 X Grippy Wheels<br/>
- Solder
# Build Instructions :
Here is how you are gonna build this project attached, is Breadboard diagram as it is easier to understand connection with breadboard diagram.<br/>
Be careful while making connections as these are bit confusing. <br/>
There are some jump wires which you need to solder. So be carefull while doing that. You need to use solder fix wires with motor. Ypu also need things like super glue to fix motors and also you need Double sided tape to fix bluetooth. Drill is also required to fix arduino and motor driver on wooden board. Nylon spacer are must. 

# Usage :<br>
It is bluetooth controlled car which is contrtolled with the help of andriod mobile phone app. First of all just upload code make sure while uploading code your bluetooth is off or disconnected otherwise you are gonna get list of erorrs which is really frustating. Make sure your bluetooth is blinking. Once blutooth is connected red light will remain on which is good. 
- Upload Code
- Open app on phone
- Connect with HC-06 bluetooth
- Now control car with remote inside app
- It will act as a remote controll Car
- Strong working car and it is really cool idea to make car at home which was kind of dream to buy in childhood.
